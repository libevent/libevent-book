Using the built-in HTTP server
==============================

:language: C

The plain network-based Libevent interface is useful if you want to build native
applications, but it is increasingly common to develop an application based
around the HTTP protocol and a web page that loads, or more commonly dynamically
reloads, information.

To use the Libevent service, you use the same basic structure as already
described for the main network event model, but instead of having to handle the
network interfacing, the HTTP wrapper handles that for you.  This turns the
entire process into the four function calls (initialize, start HTTP server, set
HTTP callback function, and enter event loop), plus the contents of the callback
function that will send data back. A very simple example is provided in listing:
